# irc-server

> A fully functional Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in **C++**.  
> This project implements the core IRC protocol (RFC 1459 subset) and allows multiple real IRC clients (e.g., **irssi**) to connect, communicate, and manage channels in real time.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The goal of **irc** is to understand and implement a fundamental Internet protocol: **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)**.  
You’ll write a complete IRC server in C++ that accepts multiple clients, manages channels, and processes IRC commands—all without forking or blocking calls.

Your server must behave like a real IRC server when tested with a standard client such as **irssi**.
